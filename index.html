        <p>I am a 21 year old Mexican-American from Petaluma, California. Although I was born in Vallejo, I consider Petaluma my hometown as I have the most memories there. I have transferred from Santa Rosa Junior College during Spring 2024 to attend SFSU to earn a Bachelor's degree in Visual Communication Design and to minor in Spanish and Japanese. I enjoy the color pink despite my gloomy appearance. In my spare time I like to play video games, exercise, and talk to my friends online. I am uncertain about what my career would look like after graduating, but I hope to figure out what design specification I want to pursue my career in after taking a handful of design classes during my time at SFSU. On top of designing, I want to integrate my knowledge of Spanish, English, and Japanese in my designs. I know this will be a fun and memorable academic journey.  </p>
