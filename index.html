        <p>I am a 21 year old Mexican-American from Petaluma, California. I am currently attending SFSU to earn a Bachelor's degree in Visual Communication Design and to minor in Spanish and Japanese.
            I enjoy the color pink despite my gloomy appearance. In my spare time I like to play video games, excersize, and talk to my friends online. I am uncertain about what
            my career would look like after graduating, but I hope to figure out what design specification I want to pursue my career in after taking a handful of design classes during my time at SFSU. </p>
